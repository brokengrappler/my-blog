    "\"I thought you just finished your first project? What're you stressing about?\" my wife asked at dinner. Little did she know that I felt unbelievable pressure to come up with a meaningful topic since I had selected a trivial one for the first of my four bootcamp projects. I tried to play it cool though and casually threw the ball back in her court. \"Yeah, I'm thinking ahead to my next project. Is there anything at work where predictive analytics might help?\"  \n",

    "**Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)** is the phenomenon of nausea, vomiting, or retching experienced by a patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or within 24 hours following a surgical procedure. The average incidence of PONV after general anesthesia is about 30% in all post-surgical patients but up to 80% in high-risk patients {% fn 1 %}. Getting a little motion sickness after an operation may not sound like it's a big deal but according to surveys, patients would rather be in pain than deal with nausea. What complicates this even further is nowadays, physicians and hospitals are reimbursed by insurance companies based on patient satisfaction surveys so if a patient gets PONV, it's not only additional resources spent helping patients recover, but also a hit to the hospital's bottom line.\n",

    "I would've loved to do more healthcare related data science projects but the primary hurdle was accessibility to data. Fortunatley for this subject, I was able to find some raw data that was available from a research paper written by a physician at the University of Sao Paulo {% fn 2 %}. While I was grateful to have the data, it wasn't the cleanest. There was a lot of information missing and some of it didn't make any sense. Example:\n",
