Little did she know that I felt unbelievable pressure to come up with a meaningful topic since I had selected a trivial one for the first of my four bootcamp projects. I tried to play it cool though and casually threw the ball back in her court. \"Yeah, I'm thinking ahead to my next project. Is there anything at work where predictive analytics might help?\"  \n",
