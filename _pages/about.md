<p>I&rsquo;m an electrical engineer by education and financial analyst by professional experience. After several years of working with MS Excel and getting more proficient with writing VBA scripts, I wanted to take my coding and data analysis to the next level. A transition into data science seemed like the logical next step in my career. While I worked in the real estate private equity industry for most of my career, I have a natural curiosity for behavioral psychology and love reading books and listening to podcasts on the subject.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not working on becoming a better data scientist, you&rsquo;ll find me on the mats or running on the trails.</p>
<p>Here are links to my social media profiles:</p>
